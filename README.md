# Registration Form

Was really inspired by the Slalom job application form. Had a really simple and neat UI form. Wanted to replicate it to learn good design.


## Todos

- [] percent completion of Registration
- [] dynamic outline on focus
- [] password validation?
- [] file upload?
- [] multipage form with transition like carousel
- [] 



## Inspiration

`Test.jsx` was basically copied from [DarkCode's video here](https://youtu.be/ydkpox94Yc0). I used the code for my own education purposes. The code/design for that component is not mine.
